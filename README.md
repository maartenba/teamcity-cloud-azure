Microsoft Azure cloud plugin for TeamCity.

License: Apache 2.0

----------
**WARNING - The Microsoft Azure cloud plugin for TeamCity is still a very early alpha version. Use with caution!**

----------

## Plugin description

This plugin provides Microsoft Azure cloud support for TeamCity. By configuring a Microsoft Azure cloud in TeamCity, a set of known virtual build agents can be started and stopped on demand by the TeamCity server.

Be sure to [read my blog post on this plugin](http://blog.maartenballiauw.be/post/2014/06/18/Microsoft-Azure-cloud-plugin-for-TeamCity-(dabbling-in-Java-code).aspx) for some more information.

## Installation

* Download the plugin ZIP file [from the latest GitHub release](/releases)
* Copy it to the TeamCity plugins folder
* Restart TeamCity server and verify the plugin was installed from ***Administration | Plugins List***
* Create a new cloud profile from ***Administration | Agent Cloud*** and [enter the requested details](docs/cloud-profile.md)

## Compatibility

Microsoft Azure cloud plugin for TeamCity has been tested with TeamCity 8.1.3.

## Features

* Start/stop existing Microsoft Azure build agents

## Roadmap/wishlist

* Create/destroy Microsoft Azure build agents based on an image
* Better looking Cloud Profile editing
* Migrate from Java to [Kotlin](http://kotlin.jetbrains.com)

## Known issues

* Only one Microsoft Azure cloud configuration can be created per TeamCity server because the ```KeyStore``` being configured by the plugin only stores one management certificate.
* Status of the VM displayed in TeamCity is not always current. The VM status is read from TeamCity's last known status, not from Microsoft Azure.
* There are a lot of unknown issues.

## Contributing/running code from IntelliJ IDEA

To contribute/run the code from IntelliJ IDEA, do the following:

* Download and extract the Linux distribution of [TeamCity](http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/download/) to your system (even on Windows).
* Clone the ```teamcity-azure-cloud``` repository.
* Open the cloned directory in IntelliJ IDEA.
* Set ```$TeamCityDistribution$``` to the path where TeamCity was extracted.
* Run the ```Server``` configuration. The TeamCity server should be available from ```http://localhost:8111/bs``` with the Microsoft Azure cloud plugin for TeamCity deployed.

## Agent VM prerequisites

For every VM that will be started/stopped using the Microsoft Azure cloud plugin for TeamCity, the following prerequisites should be in place:

* The VM should have the TeamCity agent installed and started as a service.
* The TeamCity server and agent should be able to communicate, either over the public Internet or using a Microsoft Azure VNET. It may be necessary to open certain load balancer and/or firewall ports (e.g. the TeamCity agent port 9090).
* When the agent name is configured differently than the default (hostname of the machine), the installed TeamCity agent must be authorized in the TeamCity server. If you want authorization to happen automatically, make sure the ```name``` property in ```<TeamCity Agent Home>/conf/buildagent.properties``` is set to the hostname of the virtual machine.

More information on setting up a build agent for your TeamCity server on Microsoft Azure [can be found here](docs/setup-build-agent-vm.md).
